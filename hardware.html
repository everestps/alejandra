                            the hard drive allows. The job of the hard drive is to store things that are not being used, while

                            <p>A mother board is a circuit board which essentially links up all the other parts of the computer. 
                            The motherboard is not visible to the eye until the computer is taken apart, because it is located on 
                            the very inside. Some of the many components it holds are the memory, the CPU, the RAM, etc. which are 
                            all interconnected through the motherboard allowing them to communicate with one another.

                            <p>The Random Access Memory (RAM) is a computer memory. It's a place in a computer where current used 
                            data is kept so that the computer's processor can quickly access it. The data will only be in use when
                            the computer is running, once it is off the RAM loses that data, unless turned back on which accesses 
                            the data again.

                            <p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is considered the "brains of a computer." The CPU is what receives 
                            instructions from the RAM and carries the commands that it receives from the software running on the computer
                            or hardware. It then sends back the computed outcomes so that it could carry out those commands. The function 
                            of the CPU is to process the program instructions.</p>

                            <p>The computer needs to be turned on in order to see the graphical information in
                            the monitor. This monitor is connected to the motherboard. The mouse's cursor is what shows up in the monitor- 
                            responding to movements from the user. The mouse is what allows the user to click on what is appearing in 
                            the monitor. If a box is clicked the user can use the keyboard to type things in. With the presence
                            of the RAM the computer can store current used data so that the computers processor, the CPU, can quickly access it. 
                            The CPU then receives those instructions from the RAM, and sends back the computed results to execute the commands. 
                            The hard drive can then store any files, programs, etc. so that the user can access them with time. 
                            Overall, the motherboard is what allows these components to function harmoniously as "she" is facilitating it all.</p>
