                <p>CS and IT</p>
                <p>Hello! I am Alejandra, a senior, at Everest who is interested in STEM. Computer Science and Information Technology is one of the many expedition courses provided by Everest Public High School for its students. This expeditions class occurs over 2-week intervals throughout the year for a total of 4 times. EPHS is a small charter school located in Redwood City, California that is not well known by many, because it is a small school. (If you would like to know more about Everest click on the image.) </p>

                <p>Purpose of the Class</p>
                <p>Women are vastly underrepresented in STEM- holding fewer than 25% of STEM jobs. I made the decision to take CS because I want to contribute to the act of closing the existing gender gap. This current issue is evident in our classroom considering that there are only six girls; including myself. As we are living in a fast evolving world full of technology, computers are highly used by many. Although, not many understand the capabilities of a computer. The purpose of CS is to understand how computers are used and what they can be utilized for in the real world. Currently, we are learning HTML and how it can be applied to web design. By the end of these two weeks we will have made our own website using HTML and CSS.

                <p>As you go through this site and its links you will be able to understand what HTML is and how it is applied in the Computer Science world. If you would like to know more about me, you can go read a more in depth introduction of who I am. Last but not least, computer hardware. Many own computers, but don't know how they work. Curious about a computers hardware? Make sure to check it out and read it!</p>
