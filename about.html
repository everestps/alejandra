                <p>Who is Ale?</p>
                <p>Greetings! My name is Alejandra S., and I am currently a senior at Everest Public High School. My interest for STEM grew my freshman year of high school. At the time, I was taking a Mechanical engineering class at Stanford's TLT Lab, and it fascinated me so much because it was very hands on.  As I continued to pursue my interest it was very apparent the there is an immense gender gap; I felt a bit discouraged. Being a first generation hispanic women, statistically all odds are against me. My summer of 2014 I was part of the Girls Who Code summer immersion program at Stanford University, hosted by Intel, where I had the time of my life. I was exposed to CS while enjoying the many things that could be done with it. I got to meet great successful woman such as Sheryl Sandberg, Kim Stevenson, our founder Reshma Saujani, and many more who directly asked me to "make [them] proud!" The gender gap is real, and I am committed to help increase gender parity. I am a young hispanic girl seeking to prove statistics wrong.   <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/">(More about Girls Who Code)</a></p>
