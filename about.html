                <p>Who is Ale?</p>
                <p>Greetings! My name is Alejandra S., and I am currently a senior at Everest Public High School. My interest for STEM grew my freshman year of high school. At the time, I was taking a Mechanical engineering class at Stanford's TLT Lab, and it fascinated me so much because it was very hands on.  As I continued to pursue my interest it was very apparent the there is an immense gender gap; I felt a bit discouraged. Being a first generation hispanic women, statistically all odds are against me. My summer of 2014 I was part of the Girls Who Code summer immersion program at Stanford University, hosted by Intel, where I had the time of my life. I was exposed to CS while enjoying the many things that could be done with it. I got to meet great successful woman such as Sheryl Sandberg, Kim Stevenson, our founder Reshma Saujani, and many more who directly asked me to "make [them] proud!" The gender gap is real, and I am committed to help increase gender parity. I am a young hispanic girl seeking to prove statistics wrong.   <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/">(More about Girls Who Code)</a></p>

                <p>Books & Movies</p>
                <p>I discovered my all time favorite book during middle school, and that book is The Secret Story of Sonia Rodriguez by Alan Lawrence. I really enjoyed this book because the author really made me feel what Sonia, the main character, was going through. There are some parts of the book in which I, in a way, can relate to. I have read this book so many times, and I don’t get tired of it. Which means that I really like it! Moving away from books, there are two movies that I really enjoy watching. One of them being The Curious Case of Benjamin Button; this movie is just weird and I like it. The main character, Benjamin Button, was born an old man and with the elapse of time he grows younger to where he becomes a normal baby. My other preferred movie is The Secret Life of Bees, because it depicts how life was for people of color in the south during the 1960’s while also centering on hope and love.
