                <p>Who is Ale?</p>
                <p>Greetings! My name is Alejandra S., and I am currently a senior at Everest Public High School. 
                My interest for STEM grew my freshman year of high school. At the time, I was taking a Mechanical 
                engineering class at Stanford's TLT Lab, and it fascinated me so much because it was very hands on. 
                As I continued to pursue my interest it was very apparent the there is an immense gender gap; I felt a bit discouraged. 
                Being a first generation hispanic women, statistically all odds are against me. 
                My summer of 2014 I was part of the Girls Who Code summer immersion program at Stanford University, 
                hosted by Intel, where I had the time of my life. I was exposed to CS while enjoying the many things that could be done with it. 
                I got to meet great successful woman such as Sheryl Sandberg, Kim Stevenson, our founder Reshma Saujani,
                and many more who directly asked me to "make [them] proud!" The gender gap is real, and I am committed to help increase gender parity. 
                I am a young hispanic girl seeking to prove statistics wrong. <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/">(More about Girls Who Code)</a></p>

                    <p>Books, Movies, and Music</p>
                    <p>I discovered my all time favorite book during middle school, and that book is 
                    <em>The Secret Story of Sonia Rodriguez</em> by Alan Lawrence. I really enjoyed this
                    book because the author really made me feel what Sonia, the main character, was going through.
                    There are some parts of the book in which I, in a way, can relate to. I have read this book so many times, and I don't get tired of it. 
                    Which means that I really like it! Moving away from books, there are two movies that I really enjoy watching.
                    One of them being <em>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em>; this movie is just weird and I like it. The main character, Benjamin Button, 
                    was born an old man and with the elapse of time he grows younger to where he becomes a normal baby.
                    My other favorite movie is <em>The Secret Life of Bees</em>,
                    because it depicts how life was for people of color in the south during the 1960's 
                    while also centering on hope and love.

                    <p>Hobbies</p>
                    <p>One of my favorite daily activities is Zumba. Zumba is a fitness program where you dance/exercise to
                    various styles of music. I do Zumba at least four times a week if not more. I really enjoy this activity 
                    because I like dancing; I find it really fun! I discovered Zumba my sophomore year of high school, 
                    and since then I have stuck to it. My favorite part of doing Zumba is that I am now part of another 
                    community in which I can proudly identify myself as. The best part of it all is that I have built close 
                    relationships and great friendships with people there that I wouldn't have otherwise if I had not taken that risk.</p>
