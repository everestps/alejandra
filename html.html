                <p>HTML</p>
                <p>Hypertext Markup Language, or more commonly known as HTML is a language
                used for tagging text files and making web pages look attractive. HTML originated 
                from a project that was meant for collaboration and as a collection of tools for 
                Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues who worked for CERN at the time. The most common 
                reason for why HTML is used is to create web documents. With HTML someone can add text, 
                links to other HTML pages, arrange page layouts, etc.

                <p>
                    CSS is a Cascading Style Sheet, recognized as a language, that goes hand in hand with HTML.
                    CSS is used to format the HTML page and what it looks like. For example, changing the size 
                    of an image, making borders, font size, background, etc. As Tim Berners-Lee created HTML, 
                    one of his colleagues from CERN, H. Wium Lie, created CSS. This gave the web developers more 
                    tools to style what their website looked like. When using CSS you have to refer back to an 
                    Identifier (ID) or a Class so that it knows where those stylistic properties will be applied to.

                <p>How Do Tags Work?</p>
                <p>Tags are a very essential property of HTML, because they are what make up the basic structure of 
                the HTML body. The tags are what surround the content and give it significance for when trying to run 
                the code and have it appear on the browser. There are several HTML tags that have various functions such as for when creating 
                a paragraph, a table, dividers (divs), etc. The rule for tags is that there needs to always be an opening 
                tag and a closing one. The slash is what declares when the tag is closing- giving structure to your code. Tags are IMPORTANT!

                <p>Attributes are the content that that would be inside the opening tag in which you give it a certain value 
                to customize a page further. If attributes aren't given to the code then in the browser you can only expect default 
                settings consisting of a white background, black font-color, etc. making it really boring.</p>

                            <p>Any text that you want to see in the browser needs to be in between the p tags. With the p tags you can change font size, color, the font, amd many other things. </p>

                                <p> Wouldn't it be nice if you could insert a link to a web page? Well you can with the < a href = /> attribute. 
                                There are many things you can do with this such as changing the color 
                                of the link, if you want it underline, maybe you don't want the actual link but just
                                the name of the web page. Well, you can do that too along with other cool stuff. </a></p>

                            was made with JQuery, but you can see that there are no numbers- it is just a regular list.</p>
